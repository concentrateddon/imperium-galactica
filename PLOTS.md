## A: JAIDEN KENTUR

* A young man, JAIDEN KENTUR, just turned 18, has been raised by the Religion on CHIOTIS III after being orphaned. He is taken by a priest (RHETBRAND HARRBRAS) to the Imperial City to take a vocation (with the Emperor’s permission) as he was not born into the Religion and doesn’t have the necessary aptitudes (e.g., communing or cognaution) to remain. Turns out... he’s the Emperor’s natural-born son, and the Religion believes he can Fold. Winds up being hired by the uprising family (below) as an advisor, after meeting the family head on Imperial City advising on protocols.
	* We discover the imperial link when Jaiden joins the Laxhast family. Their family priest, JETTNIC SANTEAS, does a routine genetic test—something done to help avoid potentially poor pairings amongst people. This was never done with Jaiden was younger, but it’s the custom within the Order to only do them when a priest wants to procreate, since not all do.

	1. Everyday life in the FA as he turns 18
	2. Taken to Imperial City to become an apprentice
	3. Learns the Protocol business over a year+
	4. Is hired into the Laxhast family (wasn’t “cut out” to be Protocol Master so is released)
	5. Was never Tested thoroughly for some reason, but Laxhast’s have a small population and so always test for dangerous recessives. Link to Imperial family discovered; Folding potential discovered.

## B: CATHSTE LAXHAST  

* A smaller ruling family (led by IRELLA LAXHAST)—in a system (HEMITHEA)  with no habitable planets but lots of rich asteroids and gas giants—is visited by the Imperial City. The offer is to elevate them, putting them in control of a planet (PROXIMA CENDRA IV, one of the oldest human colonies and established by slowship) that is the only source for a rare and valuable medicine (which happens to manage a genetic disease the Imperial females all have). But the Emperor can’t intervene directly—save to waive the fees on their transport, and illicitly giving them a bioweapon (under the auspices of, this is safer in your hands because you don’t have a planet) that will wipe out the existing family (led by CARLLIS STEVKIR). And everyone else on the planet. For close to a decade—they’ll have to remain in space suits for that long, basically. But it won’t affect the non-human natives who actually gather the drug, who’ve essentially been enslaved by the former ruling family.
	* Taking over the planet involves a big make-up with the local species, the HEPHITH.

1. Everyday life in an asteroid system; we see that Irella is all-business and lacks empathy and political acumen, relies on Cathste to “handle” people.
2. Imperial City visit—is entrusted with a rare and dangerous bio-weapon, given hint of offer to take over Proxima Cendra IV
	1. Cover unique medicine that Imperial family needs, produced only on PC4, hasn’t been effective of late
3. Pitches the move poorly to her people—Cathste makes it right, indicating which smaller families will take leading roles and which ones may want to stay behind and aim for elevation
4. Second Imperial City visit, loading most of population and recommending elevation of those who stayed
5. Time on Imperial City, learning politics, hiring Jaiden
6. Arrival at PC4, deployment of bioweapon, landing and takeover.
7. Meet with Guraik, who’ve been more or less enslaved and treated as sub-sentient. Determine cause of medicinal decline (substituting a different plant because the correct one has become endangered; it’s also a powerful hallucinogen and narcotic which is what most people bought it for)  

* As you might expect, there is a REBELLION of sorts, consisting of a few systems that sit outside the Imperium and who have their own rogue Folders. They refer to themselves as the UnImperium Worlds. A certain number of Imperium worlds—primarily those early ones founded by slowship—have a secret alliance with the UnImperium, as they firmly wish to break the Imperial monopoly on interstellar travel. They do not necessarily want an interstellar government _per se,_ but they’d rather negotiate their own trade and simply pay for carriage. They propose the CONSOCIATIO COMMERCIUM GRATIS, a Free Trade Guild, which would be the galaxy’s third Guild. It would continue to have a monopoly on Folding _training_, but would be subject to market powers and wouldn’t stop free agents.
