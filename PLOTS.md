## A: JAIDEN KENTUR

* A young man, JAIDEN KENTUR, just turned 18, has been raised by the Religion on CHIOTIS III after being orphaned. He is taken by a priest (RHETBRAND HARRBRAS) to the Imperial City to take a vocation (with the Emperor’s permission) as he was not born into the Religion and doesn’t have the necessary aptitudes (e.g., communing or cognaution) to remain. Turns out... he’s the Emperor’s natural-born son, and the Religion believes he can Fold. Winds up being hired by the uprising family (below) as an advisor, after meeting the family head on Imperial City advising on protocols.
	* We discover the imperial link when Jaiden joins the Laxhast family. Their family priest, JETTNIC SANTEAS, does a routine genetic test—something done to help avoid potentially poor pairings amongst people. This was never done with Jaiden was younger, but it’s the custom within the Order to only do them when a priest wants to procreate, since not all do.

	1. Everyday life in the FA as he turns 18
	2. Taken to Imperial City to become an apprentice
	3. Learns the Protocol business over a year+
	4. Is hired into the Laxhast family (wasn’t “cut out” to be Protocol Master so is released)
	5. Was never Tested thoroughly for some reason, but Laxhast’s have a small population and so always test for dangerous recessives. Link to Imperial family discovered; Folding potential discovered. Review prophesy. Test more thoroughly.
	6. Discover Jaiden has a full set of latent abilities for TP and TK; can likely be trained into Cognaution but don’t recommend it. Has the genetic markers for Communing, unsure why the FA sent him to Imperial City.

## B: CATHSTE LAXHAST  

* A smaller ruling family (led by IRELLA LAXHAST)—in a system (HEMITHEA)  with no habitable planets but lots of rich asteroids and gas giants—is visited by the Imperial City. The offer is to elevate them, putting them in control of a planet (PROXIMA CENDRA IV, one of the oldest human colonies and established by slowship) that is the only source for a rare and valuable medicine (which happens to manage a genetic disease the Imperial females all have). But the Emperor can’t intervene directly—save to waive the fees on their transport, and illicitly giving them a bioweapon (under the auspices of, this is safer in your hands because you don’t have a planet) that will wipe out the existing family (led by CARLLIS STEVKIR). And everyone else on the planet. For close to a decade—they’ll have to remain in space suits for that long, basically. But it won’t affect the non-human natives who actually gather the drug, who’ve essentially been enslaved by the former ruling family.
	* Taking over the planet involves a big make-up with the local species, the HEPHITH.

1. Everyday life in an asteroid system; we see that Irella is all-business and lacks empathy and political acumen, relies on Cathste to “handle” people. See Communing with predecessors.
2. Imperial City visit—is entrusted with a rare and dangerous bio-weapon, given hint of offer to take over Proxima Cendra IV
	1. Cover unique medicine that Imperial family needs, produced only on PC4, hasn’t been effective of late
3. Pitches the move poorly to her people—Cathste makes it right, indicating which smaller families will take leading roles and which ones may want to stay behind and aim for elevation
4. Second Imperial City visit, loading most of population and recommending elevation of those who stayed
5. Time on Imperial City, learning politics, hiring Jaiden
6. Arrival at PC4, deployment of bioweapon, landing and takeover.
7. Certain amount of palace intrigue; not every member of the family was killed (managed to survive in panic rooms but are trapped); local FA managed to seal themselves in and take Cognauts, TPs, and TKs in (we wonder about the FA as a backchannel here); some former servants provide the lay of the land in exchange for space suits. We get to see someone die and be denied an Afterlife.
8. Meet with Guraik, who’ve been more or less enslaved and treated as sub-sentient. Determine cause of medicinal decline (substituting a different plant because the correct one has become endangered; it’s also a powerful hallucinogen and narcotic which is what most people bought it for). Negotiate to get medicinal production back online at vastly reduced quantities—just enough to support Imperium. We also get the lay of the land on other potential exports, as the drug trade had become 90% of the family’s income.

## C: KENTH CARDUEL
1. Everyday life learning to Fold better. Visiting Imperium worlds who’ve agreed to keep them quiet. We learn about a couple of critical UnImperium exports.
2. ((Some things happen))
3. Visits PC4, learns of abolished drug trade (good!), gets into good terms with Laxhast family, learns that their former system would likely be open to UnImperium trade—potentially funneling fabs and such to them.

## LATER IDEAS
* PC4 family survivors (there were a few) protest to Imperium, but there are no Imperial laws regarding infighting between systems. They protest further: such a bioweapon wouldn’t have been available to Laxhast. Demand judgement. Imperium views this as a threat to Imperium and unleashes the Sexoshant.
