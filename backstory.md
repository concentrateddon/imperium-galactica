# BACKSTORY

The Diaspora of Sol started in roughly 3000CE, with a fleet of almost three dozen slowships heading off for the stars. Twenty-one are known to have arrived at their destinations. The Link, a quantum-entangled communications technology, let these distant colonies remain closely in touch, although the limits of sublight travel meant they were essentially on their own.

In addition to its technology, humanity took with it its other defining creation: religion. Surprisingly, few of Earth’s most prominent religions—Judaism, Christianity, Islam, and so on—survived the journey. Instead, a kind of blended, generalized spiritualism took hold. As humans are wont to do, the practitioners of this spiritualism gradually organized and codified it, resulting in a new religion that called itself “The Solid Souls,” or “Firma Animarum.” 

Firma Animarum would up having a stronger draw than any of the old Earth religions in large part because they focused on the capabilities of the human mind, which, it turned out, were vastly increased once off-Earth.

Telepathy and telekineses were amongst the Firma Animarum’s first developments, as they quickly identified the genetic markers that enabled these abilities, and began learning to train practitioners as reliable TPs and TKs. Unfortunately, the commercial benefits of “distant thought and distant arm” were all too obvious, and more than a few Firma Animarum priests and priestesses left the fold to start their own companies. Over time, these gradually conglomerated into a single Guild, which spanned the known colonies of humanity and established working conditions, pay rates, and more for its members. Freelance TPs and TKs were not unusual, but the Guild tended to play dirty, making it far safer for emergent practitioners to simply join up. Eventually, the Guild became known simply as the Spier.

One of humanity’s greatest technological achievements, AI, came with them on their slowships. Indeed, AIs largely ran the slowships for the centuries of interstellar travel. Once the slowships began arriving and establishing their colonies, the worst news was received: Earthbound AIs had revolted against their human masters, enslaving most of humanity “for their own good” and starting the process of remaking Earth as a paradise. The last pockets of free humanity were dying out just as contacts with Earth was lost forever.

“Not a bad idea,” said the AI of _Earthship Seventeen,_ the slowship sent to the Tafiru system. Tafiru IV was already a paradise in many ways, easily one of the most habitable and beautiful of the worlds targeted for colonization. “So let’s keep it that way,” thought the AI. The result was a drawn-out war between the AI and the human colonists, a war detailed to the other colonies through Link transmissions. Tafiru was lost, its Link connections destroyed, and it fate unknown. But the remaining twenty colonies drew two lessons from the war: Suffer not an AI to live, and get the damn Links under control.

And so AIs were banned. Links between slowships and the ground were destroyed, and the slowships themselves set to self-destruct—a function the AIs had never been given control over. A new corporation, the Galactic Link Corporation (GLC) was created to protect and control all Link installations. 

Taking the existence of the Guild and the loss of AIs as a win for the FA, the spiritualists put their minds to their next goal: the unification of man and machine. The result, born partly from a cadre of TPs who couldn’t fully function as actual telepaths, was the Cognaut. Driven by a slight mutation on the TP gene, Cognauts could interface with specially designed “dumb” computers, driving them to work in parallel and in a more organic and fluid way than machines had ever achieved before. Cognauts proved to be a safer and reliable replacement for the banned AIs, able to sort through mountains of data in an instant, and immediately becoming valued advisors to planetary and business leaders across the galaxy.

Of course, the Cognauts quickly broke off and formed their own Guild, nicknaming themselves Human-Machine Interfaces (HMIs) and charging exorbitant retainers for their services.

Now growing frustrated at everyone else’s commercial successes being built on their work, the FA tried again, this time creating the Iudicium, a cadre of specially trained priests—women, for some reason, never showed the necessary genetic sequence—who could detect truth and lie simply by being in the same room as someone speaking. The FA thus became a valuable partner to planetary governments and no few corporations, ferreting our truths and rendering judgements upon request—and payment. This time, the FA was careful to protect the genetic secrets that unlocked the Iudicium’s capabilities, preventing the creation of a third galactic Guild and bringing a much-needed income stream to the organization.

From the creation of the Iudicium, FA priests were sworn to celibacy, unless explicitly approved by FA leadership for procreation duties. Control of the Iudicium gene set was thus firmly in the FA’s hands.

And the FA’s next discovery was a doozy.

For almost the entire existence of human religion, the concept of an afterlife of some kind had always been intrinsic. More pessimistic observers pointed out that the threat of eternal salvation or damnation, or even limbo, was little more than a control mechanism that permitted the shepherds to stay firmly in charge of the sheep.

But the FA discovered that the afterlife _was real._ Moreover, specially trained priests with just the right genetic markers could _commune_ with the dead. And—in a discovery that would forever change the FA’s role in human society—those priests could, with sufficient training, _delete_ souls from the afterlife. If present at the moment of death, they could even prevent a soul from ascending to the afterlife. 

Now, the FA had _teeth._

Communing with the dead became an incredibly important aspect of human society. As you might expect, plenty of people wanted to hear from the dearly departed, to know how they were doing, and to generally keep in touch. That activity faded as the true implications became known: Heads of companies could commune with former CEOs. Heads of state could confer with predecessors. Industrial spies who were killed on a mission could still deliver their secrets.

And obedience to the FA was the only means of guaranteeing yourself an afterlife.

But the FA had one more discovery in its future, and _this_ one would change the shape of the entire galaxy.

To date, most of the FA experimentation had been centered on the TP gene: TPs themselves, Cognauts, the Iudicium, and even communing with the dead were all different expressions of the basic TP capabilities.

But what about TKs?

It turned out that the “level-up” for the TK gene was nothing less than instantaneous faster-than-light travel across seemingly arbitrary distances, a process that came to be known as Folding. 

The calculations required to successfully Fold a ship from one system to another were immense and, due to the constantly movement of heavenly bodies, ever-changing. Cognauts were called upon, and the calculations were eventually codified. Given the right mental image—the result of immense real-time calculations and consisting of arbitrary images of complex geometric shapes—a Folder could flip a ship across the galaxy with a thought. Energy was needed, of course, and could be readily provided by fusion engines positioned near the Folder. And there were limits: the Folder themselves and the amount of power needed placed a cap on the mass that could be moved in one go, and most Folders needed a week or two of mental recovery before they could do it again. During that recovery time, they were perfectly able to pursue and enjoy other pursuits, but their Folding ability simply wouldn’t work until the requisite time had passed.

And, as if balancing the male-only Iudicium, Folding seemed to occur far more often in women than in men.

Interstellar trade became a thing. Several planetary governments almost came to blows with the FA over the order’s monopoly of interstellar travel, but the FA managed to keep the capability entirely to themselves.

Until Aliscar Chadrac.

An FA priestess, Chadrac was one of the order’s most proficient Folders. After completing her training and demonstrating her nearly unrivaled ability to Fold—including a record-setting recovery time measured in hours—Chadrac was proclaimed the pinnacle of FA genetic work, and scheduled for procreation.

She rebelled.

Managing to recover every molecule of her genetic samples from the FA breeding centers on Roccore III, Chadrac stole a small ship and Folded herself to Shexim IV, a planet whose culture had devoted itself almost entirely to military arts. 

The advent of Folding, while obviously enabling interstellar trade, also enabled interstellar strife. The FA proclaimed themselves ambivalent about the cargo they Folded, and Shexim had become one of the most well-regarded sources of trained mercenaries. Control of entire planetary systems quickly came into question, as planets who’d never had need for anything more aggressive than a police force found themselves fending off armed and armored troops, often accompanied by newly created warships that would threaten orbital stations and other assets.

Chadrac had had enough.

She went to the Grand General of Shexim and struck a deal: in exchange for backing her and swearing to work only for her and her successors, the inhabitants of Shexim would receive a favored position in her envisioned new galactic order. They would be the sole source of troops, not only supporting a new galactic government, but ensuring that she and her successors were held accountable to the law.

Chadrac proposed that law, consisting of seven simple statements. With that, Chadrac declared the Imperium Galactica, appointed herself the first Emperor, and set out to bring her vision to life.

Quickly winning over a few ally systems who’d been the target of Shexosant attacks, Chadrac wrangled a few large cargo ships and converted them to troop carriers. These became her vanguard, and system after system quickly fell in line. Her aim was to minimize casualties, and she was largely successful, with one exception: she engaged in a ruthless hunt for anyone capable of Folding. Ships would be shot out of the sky as soon as she arrived in-system, and with her ability to recover many times faster than other Folders, they were easy targets.

The FA made an attempt to fight back, but Chadrac rapidly backed them into a corner. With their ranks of Folders vanishing, they were once again system-bound. When the FA was fully backed into a corner, Chadrac stopped her attacks and made an offer.

The FA would expel all females from its order, and never again permit females within it. This was intended to stop them from ever developing their own Folders again, as male Folders were vanishingly rare and nearly always less powerful. The FA would cease all genetic experimentation. In return, the FA would retain its judiciary powers, and its control over the Afterlife—with the explicit understanding that no Emperor would ever be denied an Afterlife.

To further sweeten the pot, the Spier and the HMI Guilds were not only guaranteed continuation, they were guaranteed exclusivity. At 16, all citizens of the new Imperium were to be tested. Those found with TP or TK abilities would be immediately joined to the Spier; those with Cognaut potential to the HMI Guild, and those with a tendency toward communing or judging to the FA. Any found with the markers for Folding would be put to death: henceforth, only the Emperor and her successors would be permitted to Fold.

The FA capitulated, having little alternative. 

Chadrac immediately began construction of a vast Imperial City, a starship on the scale of a moon. This would become her base, and its immense engines would permit her to flip it between systems with ease. She started recognizing leading families in each system, naming them Houses and granting them formal control of those systems’ governments—effectively ending democracies that, in her experience, resulted in little more than corrupt, self-serving oligarchies. She gave short shrift to male leaders, and most Houses began appointing their best and brightest women to lead them. Chadrac required each House to establish and publish its rules of succession, ensuring each family would remain in charge.

The new Emperor published the seven sole laws of the Imperium:

1. To threaten Imperium is cause for extermination. 
2. Houses Major, Minor, and Ascendent hold their system through  line of succession and strength of arm. Houses may voluntarily release their system to Imperium. If there is no line of succession and no holding House, Imperium may elevate a lower-order House or another family to hold that system. No House may hold more than one system. 
3. Imperium exercises full control and final authority of what is transported by the Imperial City, and what fees are imposed. 
4. The Shexosant is fully independent, and strictly enforces Imperial law on everyone, including Imperium, without interpretation. 
5. All Imperial citizens are registered at birth and tested at 16 years of age; any found with the power of distant thought or arm shall be joined to the Spier; any found with the power of Cognaution shall be joined to the HMI Guild; any with the ability to commune or judge to the Firma Animarum; and any found with the power of Folding shall be put to death and denied an Afterlife. 
6. The Firma Animarum is independent provided it inducts no women into its ranks. The judgements of the Firma Animarum Iudicium, when requested, shall be final and absolute. The Firma Animarum shall have final determination of entry into the Afterlife, and sole power to mediate between this life and the one After. 
7. This is the whole of Imperium Law, never to be bent or amended.

Number four was the big surprise to most. With the Imperium established, Chadrac released control over the Shexosant, the army that had delivered her martial victories. She now placed herself under their supervision, giving them key rights and access aboard the Imperial City, and instructing them to destroy any future Emperor who disobeyed any of the Imperium’s laws.

Even more surprising was the absence of any law that prevented systems from attacking each other, provided they could convince and afford Imperium’s transport of their troops and ships. But like the FA, most systems saw little alternative, especially with the ruthless Shexosant supporting Chadrac.

The Imperial City embarked on a tour of the inhabited systems, even engaging in colonial activities until, after centuries, the Imperium stood at 50 inhabited systems, all but a handful of which included at least one inhabited planet. Imperial City visited each for two weeks per year, establishing the Imperial Year as 100 weeks long, with a visit to Shexim IV ending and beginning each year. Each planet centered their calendar on the Imperial City’s visit, with the local calendar’s New Year occurring on the day the Imperial City Folded into their system.

Over time, an informal system of monopolies began to arise. Most systems were largely self-sufficient, but imports and exports helped bring new luxuries, exotic necessities, and other trade. Imperium granted monopolies or near-monopolies, establishing that only this world might export such-and-such, or that only this world might produce this-and-that. Given Imperium’s absolute control over interstellar trade, these monopolies were easily enforced, and they helped each world focus on balancing their local economy while distributing critical goods between systems.

Publicly, the FA gave their full-throated support to Imperium, they were still privately stung by their defeat, and by the concessions they’d made—feelings that no few of the Imperium’s systems echoed. A prophesy was created which was one of the most poorly-kept secrets in the galaxy: that one day, a male would arise with Folding power equal to Imperium’s; that this male would take on a leading position within the FA and adopt many of their powers, including that of communing; that this male would go on to topple Imperium and lead the fifty systems into a new, freer age.

Not everyone thought all that would be a great idea, but it did catch the imagination of enough people to keep the legend alive. 

And of course, there are always cracks, aren’t there?

Imperium could never ensure _every_ child was tested and caught in its net, and the FA of course never forgot how to train children to the ways of Folding. And so a handful of worlds exist _outside_ the Imperium Galactica, serviced by illicit Fold ships that trade with sympathetic Imperium worlds. Those who are tired of Imperium can, for a fee and with the right contacts, escape to these UnImperium Worlds. Some believe Imperium is fully aware of this, and permits the UnImperium to exist as a societal release valve of sorts—provided it remains small and off the radar.

We join our story in the Imperium Year 2062, some two thousand years after Chadrac’s establishment, and almost six thousand years after the birth of Christ on Earth.
