# CHARACTERS

**JAIDEN KENTUR**
18 years old, raised as an orphan by the Firma Animarum.
> Flaw: Was not raised to have self-agency; has no control over his own life choices. This frustrates him at times, but at the start, he sees no way out of it. Was raised to serve, not to lead or even fully participate.

**RHETBRAND HARRBRAS**
The Revered Father who basically raised Jaiden; serves as a minor advisor on Voccides IV.
> Note: Knows Jaiden is an actual son of Imperium.

## House Laxhast
**IRELLA LAXHAST**
Head of House Laxhast, a House Ascendant in charge of the Hemithea system.
> Motivation: Wants family to become a House Minor and be able to live in an actual atmosphere; is myopically focused on the family success and safety. Treats subordinate families more as tools than as allies.

**CATHSTE LAXHAST**
Oldest daughter and heir apparent; 22 years old and taking on more and more daily responsibilities.
> Motivation: Disagrees with Irella’s family-first-and-only approach; believes that the key to becoming a House Major (has bigger ambitions than Mom) is in having a large, loyal, and well-taken-care of extended house.

**JAKMAR CATTROE**
Revered Father who advises the family.
> Note: Being the advisor for a House Ascendent (especially in a non-planetary system) is a pretty low-end posting. Jakmar is older, and burned bridges within the FA when he was younger; he’s effective so he wasn’t demoted past this point, but this is basically his punishment.

## House Stevkir
**CARLLIS STEVKIR**
Head of House Stevkir, a House Major in charge of the Proxima Cendra system. 

## House Twincan
**AYLITIA TWINCAN**
Head of House Twincan, a House Major, in charge of the Gozion system—owners of the Link.
> Note: A petty, spoiled leader who relies on the largesse of their monopoly to maintain a decadent lifestyle. Cares little for leadership and leaves most of her system’s management to advisors and delegates. Immediate family lives a full-on Nero-level lifestyle, even to the point of being open defiant to Imperium because ‘they can’t live without us.’

## On the Imperial City
**JACOBRY CAGTEN**
Aging Master of Protocol.
> Note: Effective, curmudgeonly, gruff. Has no children, or else they’d likely have inherited his position.

## Galactic Leaders
**ZOEAVE CHADARC**
“Imperium;” the head of the Imperium. Fifty-second Imperium. Granddaughter to ALISCAR, who founded the modern Imperium.
> Motivation: Secretly only has one 22-year-old daughter, who is struggling with Folding. Worries about the line of succession and even maintaining the Imperium. Knows her own clock is ticking and feels pressured to produce another heir with donor sperm.

**ALIJAI CHADRAC**
Daughter of Imperium.
> Motivation: Secretly hates Imperium, the sequestration she lives under, and all of Imperial City, but only because she’s super-entitled. Lives in fear that her Folding ability will never develop and what that will force Carllis to do.

**IMPERIAL HIGH PRIEST CURTUS PENMYN**
Overall head of the Firma Animarum.
> Motivation: Is fully aware that Imperium has a living son. Loyally advises Imperium until that conflicts with realization of the Prophesy.

**IMPERIAL GENERAL COLMAR ALLSTO**
Head of the Shexosant.
> Note: Gruff, stern, uncompromising. One of the only people who can stand up to Imperium, but will only do so when Imperial Law is involved.

**CLAYMIL OVENELL**
Guildmaster of the Spier.

**CARLYND LUCEND**
Guildmaster of the Cognaut’s Guild.
