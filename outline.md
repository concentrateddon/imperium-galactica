# BLOCKING

## ACT ONE
### BLOCK ONE
#### CH 01 / CHIOTIS III • 2061-100 (local)
* We meet Jaiden and his situation. Get a solid feel for “life as usual” inside a Firmas Solas monastery. End-of-year celebrations.

#### CH 02 / HEMITHEA B-76882 • 2062-1 (local) • 2062-62 (Imperium)
* We meet the Laxhast family, in their capital residential area for this sector. Cathste is reporting on overall efficiency and a problem on one of the mining outposts. They’ve just received some new equipment and offloaded a ton of rare minerals; Imperial City just left. We want a look at daily life, and a discussion between mother and daughter on some of the latest Imperial gossip. Bring in the “rumored” UnImperium systems. Want to see the role of a Spier telekinetic at work. Wind-down of the New Year celebrations and back to the grindstone. Introduce a bit of the in-system politics; this is a huge asteroid field, and so there are various “bannermen” who work under the Laxhast family. Also introduce the immediate family, including their Revered Father, their Cognaut, and so on. Introduce complaints about the Link system.

#### CH 03 / CHIOTIS III • 2062-1 (local) • 2062-52 (Imperium)
* Happy New Year! As the Imperial City visits Chiotis, year 5062 begins for the local system. Jaiden is taken to the Imperial City to find a Vocation. We learn why he’s less-suitable for a vocation in the current system; Imperium gives its permission and suggests an apprenticeship to Master of Protocol, who is aging. Get a feel for the Imperial Court.

#### CH 04 / IMPERIAL CITY • 2062-68 (Imperium)
* 12 weeks pass. Jaiden begins to settle into his new life; we visit the next system and see how the Master of Protocol works. Note switch to Imperium calendar where it’s actually week 68. Really dig into the Imperial Court and get an arms-length view of politics and infighting; Jaiden overhears a bit of an argument (Emperor+General) over the UnImperium systems and the belief that certain Slowship worlds are supporting them.

#### CH 05 / HEMITHEA C-88924 • 2062-26 (local) • 2062-88 (Imperium)
* The family is dealing with some broken equipment—older stuff, so it’s not surprising, but it’s inconvenient. We talk about incoming orders, we place a Link order for new equipment—noting that it’s timely, as Imperial City will visit Kagadus next, which is where most of the heavy equipment comes from. And since Melvarth is after that... maybe it’s time to invest in an automated fab. Really look at how the Imperial City schedule drives so much. Bring up Podryria, one of three banking worlds (only non-monopoly trade), which usually is fine backing investments for the family. Also a bit of a minor crisis with one of the “bannermen” families as a matriarch dies without leaving a female heir. Approval to let a male continue in the interim, with the possibility of permanence. That’s rare, but here in the non-planet systems, you rely more on good people than on good politics.

#### CH 06 / IMPERIAL CITY + HEMITHEA B-76882 • 2063-01 (local) • 2063-62 (Imperial)
* It’s now been over a year for Jaiden. The Imperial City is due today, and Laxhast is eagerly awaiting new mining equipment and fab plants. That male has been made permanent and has risen to a position of importance locally. A local boy has tested positive for telekinesis and will be taken to Imperial City for handoff to the Spier. Revered Father warns against having too prominent of a male. Visits the Imperial City and meets Jaiden, who provides invaluable political advice as well as protocols. Part of the visit will be a goal to learn if this UnImperium thing is true; if so, perhaps they could be additional trading partners (but how would they move goods? They’d have to have rogue Folders, wouldn’t they? Wouldn’t that get us in trouble?)

### BLOCK TWO
#### CH 07 / IMPERIAL CITY + HEMITHEA • 2063-02 (local) • 2063-63 (Imperial)
* Imperium makes the offer to the Laxhurst family (this is the City’s second week in the system). They accept, and on the way out ask Jaiden to join them, when the time comes, as a political advisor. Make it clear that Jaiden has really gained some political acumen in his short time. We sound out Jaiden on the UnImperium before the meeting with the Emperor, and on the political situation after.
