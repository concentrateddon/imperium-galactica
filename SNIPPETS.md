## Jaiden learns about the past and the prophesy
Father Cattroe steepled his fingers in front of himself, seeming to weigh something before speaking. “So,” he said at last, “how much do you know about the _Prophetia Restitutionis et Libertatis?”_

Jaiden blinked. “The what?”

Cattroe’s eyes widened. “Spirits above,” he breathed. “I’d assumed Father Harrbras—I mean, he must have... well. Never mind, it’s never to late to learn. The phrase means, ‘prophesy of restoration and freedom,’ roughly. It’s in an extremely old Earth tongue, one that died centuries before the Diaspora. The Firma Animarum created it around the time of Institution, when the Imperium was founded. It’s... honestly, it’s more of a mission statement than a prophesy. It’s meant to be a secret, something only spoken of within the order, but it’s probably our worst-kept secret.”

“What’s it say?”

“That... actually, how much do you know about the Institution?”

Jaiden shrugged. “As much as anyone, I guess. The colonies of Earth had devolved into war, Folding was at risk of dying, and Aliscar Chadrac saved everyone. She established routine interstellar trade, built Imperial City, and kept Folding from going extinct.”

Cattroe snorted. “That’s the official story, yes. The Firma Animarum, internally at least, remembers the actual history. We _created_ the ability to Fold, you know.” Jaiden opened his mouth, but couldn’t think of a thing to say, but his expression obviously said everything for him. “Not that either? Harrbras was really playing it close to the vest. Well then, a bit of history.” He paused. “Actually, why don’t you pour us both a glass of _kef?_ There’s a carafe over there on the sideboard.”

Jaiden rose and turned, spotting the glass carafe and a small collection of glasses. He crossed to the sideboard, poured two glasses, and carried them back to the table.

“You, ah... you’ve never had _kef_ before, I take it?”

“No.”

“Normally you pour perhaps a centimeter,” Cattroe said with a grin, nodding toward the nearly-full glasses Jaiden had brought. “But in this case, we may need the additional fortification. But you’ll wan to sip it, trust me.”

Jaiden took a small swallow of the dark-brown liquid. It tingled the tip of his tongue, and a warmth spread quickly in his mouth as he swallowed. That warmth revealed a deep, spicy note as the _kef_ rolled over the back of his tongue, and as it slipped down his throat—

He coughed as his throat seemed to burn and melt.

“Good stuff, eh?” Cattroe asked with a mischievous smile. He took a sip of his own, closing his eyes and nodding in appreciation as he swallowed. “All right, then. 

“Back on Earth, humanity practiced dozens of different religions, many of which directly opposed each other. Within them, each had different sects and divisions. All of them tried to come along for the Diaspora, but once the colonists arrived to their new homes, nobody had time for it. As a result, most of those religions either died out, or became amalgamated into a new, more pragmatic order. One focused on the improvement of the human mind, more so than the human spirit. Keep in mind that, at the time, most religions made claims about an afterlife, but none of them could actually prove anything. Communing didn’t exist at the time.”

“Was that pragmatic order the Firma Animarum?” 

The priest nodded. “The beginnings of it, at least. Our predecessors had access to extensive genetic knowledge and technology, much of which our order has managed to preserve in some form or another. Freed of restrictive Earth governments and faced with unprecedented colonial challenges, they dug in. Our first results were telepathy and telekinesis, both fairly straightforward expressions of a mildly recessive gene set.”

“What, the Firma Animarum _created_ distant thought and arm?”

“As they’re known today, yes. And the order never tried to commercialize it; the Spier exists today because some of the people we have those abilities to decided to commercialize them.” He shrugged. “Can’t really blame them. Silly of us not to have done it ourselves.

“The next innovation played on telepathy. You know about the machine wars?”

“And the destruction of the twenty-first colony, yes.”

“We still had computers, as we do today, but they weren’t sentient. Or even close. Once the post-war restrictions were put into place, computers were limited in their capacity, to ensure no machine intelligence could ever rise again. But that also limited humanity. And so the Firma Animarum’s priest-scientists explored a variation of the telepathy gene, creating the Cognauts.”

_”Wait,_ the order created the HMIs?”

“Originally. Obviously once they broke off and formed their own guild—again—they refined their abilities a lot. And now of course, they’re the only ones allowed to have any computers of any kind. But their ability to link dozens of machines lets them approximate the speed and power of the old machine intelligences, without anywhere near the same risk.”

“HMIs are blood and bone,” Jaiden recited.

“Indeed.” The priest took a sip of _kef_ before continuing. Jaiden eyes his glass, but decided to wait. “The order continued to experiment. The telepathy gene’s expression seemed infinitely flexible, and although most combinations didn’t result in anything useful, the next discovery was a big one.”

“Let me guess.”

“Go ahead.”

“The Iudicium.”

“Got it in one. And honestly, it’s surprising they didn’t stumble across that one sooner. It’s actually closer to the bath telepathy capability. I think the focus on Cognaution was more about solving a practical problem. But yes, the Iudicium was next, and this time the order kept them close. In fact, the creation of the Iudicium was what led to the reformation of the entire Firma Animarum in its current state. Every colony wanted their own Iudex, since the ability didn’t work across the Link.”

“But wait, Folding didn’t exist yet, right?”

“Correct. And so the Iudicium was limited to Podryria V. That’s where the majority of the order’s priest-scientists were located, and it’s why the Firma Animarum still calls Podryria home, even if the High Priest never leaves Imperial City.”

“So next you’ll tell me the order invented Folding.”

“No, the next discover was somewhat more momentous.”

Jaiden’s eyes widened, and he took a careful sip of _kef._ “Afterlife?”

Cattroe nodded. “Afterlife. Another expression of that every-helpful telepathy gene, this time allowing us to reach beyond this world. Believe it or not, the Cognauts helped with that one—in order to Commune, a practitioner needs to hold a very precise pattern in their mind, so that their thoughts can reach into the next life. Cognaution helped develop that, once early experiments revealed the potential. Additional patterns—very closely guarded, I can assure you—let us ease a soul’s transition to Afterlife, or block the way entirely.”

“And that’s what fully established the order.”

“In terms of being a galactic power, yes. More so than even the Iudicium, for all that those priests fill a far more practical role. And Communing can be taught over the Link, so every priest in the order with the right genetic markers could learn it. Obviously, we started breeding fairly selectively at that point, until today nearly every priest can touch Afterlife.”

“And _then_ they created Folding,” Jaiden joked.

“Correct.”

Jaiden’s jaw dropped. “You’re serious?”

“I am. Experiments with the telekinesis gene had been ongoing for centuries, but that gene is far more dependent on a set of tightly interlocked recessives. Getting it to do something else, something bigger, took immense time. But eventually, they cracked it. And that’s where we start to come back to the _Prophetia Restitutionis et Libertatis._ You see, initially, the priest-scientists were able to breed for the Folding gene fairly reliably. They needed immense input from the Cognauts—the trick to Folding is to have an incredibly precise, very detailed pattern in mind, which triggers the practitioner’s ability and directs their mind to the desired destination. Today, the pattern for every Imperium system is said to be engraved into metal plates in the Emperor’s Folding Room. But a _huge_ population of Folders was created in short order. Given the commercial impact, there was no way the Firma Animarium could maintain control, but the practitioners never coalesced into a guild, either. They tended to be under contract to a specific system government, so that the governments could have full control of trade.”

“And war.”

“Eventually, yes. Of course.” Cattroe took another sip of _kef,_ and Jaiden joined him. “Humans will always want more, no matter how much they have. So yes, war. _Wars,_ actually. New colonies, of course, but then many of them joined in the warring as well.” He shrugged. “The order did what it could, threatening to withhold Afterlife, delivering biting judgements, everything they could, but it didn’t really make an impact.”

“Until Aliscar Chadrac.”

“Until House Chadrac, yes. They ruled Thotonia, back then. They were the only ruling family to risk one of their own to the Firma Animarium breeding programs, but it paid off. Aliscar was the most reliable, precise, and competent Folder the galaxy had ever seen. Backed by sufficiently powerful engines, she could Fold a seemingly infinite amount of mass with almost no personal effort—something we’d never before achieved.”

“So she ended the wars.”

Cattroe laughed. “Hardly. She _went_ to war. She allied with the largest clans on Shexim IV, used them to build an army. She devastated a half-dozen systems, attacked any Fold-capable ships she came across, and created enough general havoc that the remaining systems were willing to do almost anything to appease her. And when they finally asked what she wanted, she told them.”

“Imperium.”

“Imperium,” Cattroe said with a sigh, sipping more _kef._ “She killed everyone capable of Folding who wasn’t in her family. She threatened to annihilate the Firma Animarium unless we came to terms.”

“Terms?” 

“No more experiments. Human genetic legacy would extend no further. Our priest-scientists had to sacrifice themselves and were to be denied Afterlife.”

“They _did_ that?”

“Of course not, but we don’t talk about it outside the order. The Spier and the HMI Guild remained autonomous—everyone needs them too much. The Iudicium was institutionalized, made part of the Imperium’s fabric. We’d gotten them to most of the colonies by that point, but Chadrac made it a condition of her peace that the order, completed with an Iudicium contingent, be given a place on each world. And she gained a monopoly on Folding, and started construction on Imperial City.”

“This still doesn’t explain the prophesy,” Jaiden pointed out.

“Doesn’t it? The Firma Animarium had _everything._ We’d unlocked telepathy, telekinesis, Cognaution, and Folding. We held the Iudicium and Afterlife in our fists. We were poised to become the most powerful force in the galaxy.”

“I mean, you let at least two guilds get away.”

“We were badly managed,” Cattroe acknowledged. “The original priest-scientists were horrible at politics. But to be subjugated under Imperium, under Chadrac... it was humbling. I’m sure every system felt the same, but nobody had any choice.”

“Because of the Shexosant.”

“Indeed. And Chadrac’s deal with them was, frankly, ingenious. They were the _only_ system not fully subjugated to Imperium. They stand independent of the Emperor, charged with holding _her_ to Imperial Law along with the rest of us. But what is the first Law?”

“To threaten Imperium is cause for extermination,” Jaiden quoted.

“Precisely. And Chadrac’s clever conflation of herself _and_ the institution as ‘Imperium’ means threatening her, her family, Imperial City, or the institution of Imperium will gain you the attention of a Shexosant army, the most powerful military force in the galaxy. Not to mention cutting you off from the rest of the Imperium.”

Jaiden nodded, finally starting to see where this was going. “So is the prophesy about returning the Firma Animarium to power?”

Cattroe nodded. “Essentially. It’s why I describe it more as a mission statement than a prophesy. But the cards are stacked against it.”

“How so?”

“Folding is an expression of the base telekinesis gene, backed by enormous amounts of raw energy and the practitioner’s singular focus. All of that comes from a ridiculously recessive set of genes. Tweak _anything_ in the genome and you’re likely to produce a child who can’t Fold.”

“But Imperium has been in place for... centuries,” Jaiden pointed out.

“Zoeave Chadrac is a clone of her however-many-greats-grandmother, just as her daughters, however many of them there are now, are clones of Zoeave.” Jaiden’s eyes bugged out, but the priest simply shrugged. “Nobody talks about it, but it’s widely acknowledged. It’s why Imperium only has daughters. The Folding gene sequence was always more tightly aligned to females anyway, just as Communing is almost impossible to breed into females.”

“So what _is_ this prophesy?” Jaiden asked slowly.

“That one day, a male will arise with the power of both Communing and Folding. He will be part of the Firma Animarium, and will learn the ways of the Iudicium. He will overthrow Imperium, sit on the throne in Imperial City, and bring about a new galactic order.”

Jaiden simply stared at Father Cattroe for a long, quiet moment. “An order where the Firma Animarium rules,” he added softly.

“Obviously. But the thing is, nobody ever really thought the _Prophetia Restitutionis et Libertatis_ could come true. Even pre-Imperium, fewer than 10% of Folders were male, and they tended to have serious defects elsewhere in their genome. Early-age dementia was common, along with numerous physical abnormalities.”

Jaiden’s heart felt unnaturally still. “You called me up here because the results of my genetic assay were complete,” he whispered.

Cattroe downed the rest of his _kef_ in one long swallow. “I did.”

“And?”

“Sure you don’t want to drink that?”

“Just tell me.”

“As near as I can tell, you are somehow the natural-born son of Zoeave Chadrac. You carry all the genetic markers for the Iudicium, for Communing with Afterlife, and for Folding. You are, in short, the _ Stellarum Libertas,_ the one that the prophesy speaks of.”

Jaiden stared at the priest for a long moment before lifting his glass of _kef_ and tossing the contents down his throat.
